# secret-scan.sh — the pre-publish secret and anonymity release gate. CANONICAL COPY.
#
# SCAN_VERSION below is the consolidation handle. This script is copied into every package, so the
# only defence against the drift that produced twelve different gates is a version stamp that CI can
# compare against estate/templates/secret-scan.sh. Bump it when this file changes; never edit a
# package's copy in place.
SCAN_VERSION=2026-08-09.2
#
# WHY ONE COPY. Before 2026-08-09 this script existed in three generations across 18 packages: ten
# scanned the built image, eight scanned only the repo, and the denylists ranged from 5 patterns to
# 19. "secret-scan passed" therefore meant something different in every repository, which is the
# same class of defect as a gate that does not run at all — worse, because it reports green.
#
# Scans TWO surfaces and exits non-zero on ANY hit:
#   1. the publishable repo file set, meaning what a `git push` would expose
#      (tracked union untracked-but-not-ignored), and
#   2. the built container image filesystem, which is the artefact already public on GHCR.
# Run before every publish, and before flipping any image to public.
#
# Why two surfaces: .dockerignore SHOULD keep secrets out of the build context, but "should" is a
# claim. Scanning the actual image is the proof, and the image is what the world pulls.
#
# THE DENYLIST PATTERN. Box-specific, identity-specific and session-specific strings live in the
# GITIGNORED .anonymize-list, so this published script never itself leaks the very strings it hunts
# for. That is the mistake the naive "patterns inline in the tracked script" approach makes. Only
# generic credential SHAPES are inlined here. Add these to .gitignore:
#
#     .anonymize-list
#     *token*.txt
#     .env
#     .env.*
#     phase-notes/
#     .claude/
#
# .anonymize-list holds one extended-regular-expression per line, blank lines and # comments
# ignored. Populate it with: the box FQDN and any subdomain of it, the private mirror host, sibling
# app names, real email addresses, the operator's usernames, and any session-specific identifier.
# If the file is absent the scan still runs but proves far less, and says so loudly.
#
# Usage: test/secret-scan.sh [IMAGE]
#   IMAGE defaults to $SCAN_IMAGE, else the dockerImage in CloudronManifest.json, else repo-only.
#   SCAN_INFISICAL_NAMES="NAME1 NAME2" additionally fetches those exact token values from Infisical
#   into a mode-600 scratch file for fixed-string matching. Off by default: it puts real secret
#   values on disk for the duration of the scan, which is a deliberate trade, not a default.

  # --- runtime-managed files are NOT image content -------------------------------------------
  # Both engines bind-mount /etc/hosts, /etc/resolv.conf and /etc/hostname into every container, so
  # a `run`-based grep reads the HOST'S copies and reports the operator's own machine as a leak
  # inside the artefact. Found 2026-08-08 by this package's first CI run: it failed on /etc/hosts
  # entries naming the rig. Verified against the mounted image layers: the image ships /etc/hosts
  # and /etc/resolv.conf as EMPTY files and /etc/hostname as "localhost.localdomain" — the rig's
  # names exist only in the RUNNING container's copy. podman's default base_hosts_file="" means
  # "seed it from the host's file", which is how the runner machine's own hosts entries came to
  # look like the contents of a published image.
  #
  # Suppress what can be suppressed, then PROVE the rest rather than trusting it: copy each path out
  # of a CREATED, NEVER STARTED container — which reads the image layers with no injection — and
  # scan those copies with the same patterns. A file the image genuinely ships is still scanned; one
  # it does not ship is simply absent. Only then are the container-side hits for these exact paths
